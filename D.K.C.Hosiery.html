          <p class="center">
            Modi jackets are a type of men's outerwear inspired by the
            traditional Indian achkan or sherwani. They are commonly made from
            luxurious fabrics such as silk, brocade, or jacquard, and often
            feature intricate embroidery or embellishments. These jackets are
            versatile and can be worn with traditional Indian attire like
            kurta-pajama or paired with Western outfits for a fusion look. They
            are available in various types, including single-breasted and
            double-breasted designs, with options for sleeveless or full
            sleeves. Modi jackets add a touch of elegance and sophistication to
            any ensemble, making them a popular choice for formal occasions,
            weddings, or cultural events.
